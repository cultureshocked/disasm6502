# disasm6502
A disassembler for 6502 bytecode.

## The Assembler
See the prototype assembler [here](https://github/com/cultureshocked/asm6502).

## What is supported?
No fancy formats -- if you rip the `.text` section or any actual program code from a 6502 binary, this project should be able to disassemble it. No guarantee on symbol resolution, though.

## License
None at the moment.
